# SentryRTC-SentrySideCpp

This repo is part of a project to allow me to control in real time an internet connected robot from anywhere. The code in this repo is meant to run on a raspberry pi 4, although it could run a raspberry 3 with some modification. The controller app is developed using Unity and is tested to target Android and PC. The other half of this project is located here (https://github.com/jedhutto/SentryRTC-UnityClientApp). 

The core of this project is WebRTC. WebRTC was chosen for its great connection management and its low latency video transmission.
